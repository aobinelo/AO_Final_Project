    "text": "Methods\nDue to the data limitations for the current financial year, data from the second financial quarter of 4 years, 1993, 2003, 2013, and 2023 was utilized for analysis. A 10 year spread was thought to be ideal for assessing the general trends in airfare data. The datasets from this chosen time frames were downloaded directly from the Transportation Bureau’s website, using the above link, into .csv files.\nMost of the data processing and cleaning was done using the dplyr, tidyverse and baseR packages. As part of data processing, variables names were altered to aid in the coding process. As part of data processing, variables names were altered to aid in the coding process. Variable types were changed to the appropriate type (numeric or character).\nMissing Values: Included in each dataset was ‘2022 Passengers’, a variable which compares the amount of domestic passengers each airport sees in 2022. A missing value or a value of 0 indicate these airports don’t provide commercial domestic flights, so entries with these values were removed since they would not be airports the consumer is choosing from.\nCoordinate data: For the purpose of additional analysis, coordinate data was taken from The Humanitarian Data Exchange which compiled a dataset of longitude and latitude values for 508 major US airports. This coordinate dataset was merged with the BTS datasets.\nValidation: Cross-validation was done by comparing the inflation adjusted fare variable for each year (Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2) provided originally with my dataset with an dollar to dollar conversion between that year and 2023.\nConversions:\n1993: 1-&gt;2.13\n2003: 1-&gt;1.67\n2013: 1-&gt;1.32\n\n\n  Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2_1993 check.adj.93 Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2_2003 check.adj.03\n1                   219.846     221.9758                   402.720     406.0605\n2                   267.383     269.9732                   393.425     396.6885\n3                   281.144     283.8672                   385.678     388.8779\n4                   283.787     286.5361                   400.977     404.3037\n5                   286.958     289.7375                   379.557     382.7055\n  Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2_2013 check.adj.13 Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2_2023 check.adj.23\n1                   208.124     210.4159                   176.255      176.255\n2                   544.805     550.8070                   461.966      461.966\n3                   457.750     462.7933                   392.579      392.579\n4                   516.517     522.2078                   443.932      443.932\n5                   439.538     444.3806                   355.561      355.561\n\n\nThe results indicate a very close coincidence between the BTS inflation adjusted fare and our calculated conversion variable, indicating that the dataset is valid with regards to fare cost.\nAnalysis: Given that the research question centers around LAX and BOS airports, the overall dataset was queried for trends in relation to these two airports. Due to the great geographic distance between these airports, the overall dataset was stratified by location to better understand region-specific baseline trends. Scatterplots were used to visualize trends between continuous variables. Bar plots were used to visualize continuous variables by categorical variables."

Again, 2023 fares range lower than in previous decades when comparing inflation adjusted averages. From these figures, its starting to look like I might actually be paying less to fly out of LAX and BOS, two high traffic airports, than I would be in previous years.\n\n\nGeographic Un-adjusted Fare Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking specifically at Logan and LAX by year, it appears that the average ticket out of Logan stagnated between 1993 and 2003, then uptrended between 2013 and 2023. The average ticket out of LAX uptrended slightly between 1993 and 2003, then increased more significantly between 2013 and 2023. On average, the price of a ticket out of Logan was higher than a ticket out of LAX in 1993 and 2003, but below a ticket our of LAX in 2013 and 2023.\nHow much compared to 1993?\n\n\n  Airport comp_fare\n1     BOS   369.449\n2     LAX   278.577\n\n\n[1] 648.026\n\n\nOn average, I would be paying $648 more for a round trip in 1993 when comparing inflation adjusted rates. So it looks like, at least comparing the years that I did, I actually have it better off with what I pay now compared to what I would be paying in 1993."

    "text": "Conclusion\nEvidently, by inflation adjusted values, I am paying less for a trip between LAX and BOS than I have in the past. This begs the question of why it feels as if I am not. This can probably be answered best by looking at the unadjusted fare comparisons in Figure 3. Looking specifically at unadjusted fares out of Logan and LAX by year which show that overall, the unadjusted fare for airline tickets out of LAX and BOS are higher in 2023 than compared to years prior. While inflation adjusted values provide a good gauge of the “true” cost of a purchase in relation to the strength of the dollar, unadjusted amounts are the “ouch” one feels when actually paying for something in the moment. Since the unadjusted values are higher than they have been in the past, this is likely why it anecdotally feels like airfare prices are going up. The above study does have significant limitations, namely that limitations in man-power limit our analysis to 4 timepoints separated by a decade. Due to this, this analysis definitely misses more acute variation in the dataset, and additionally does not account for the remaining financial quarters of the year.The above study does have significant limitations, namely that limitations in man-power limit our analysis to four time points separated by a decade.

The average ticket out of LAX on the other-hand seems to have up trended steadily since 1993, starting at under $350 to a little over $400 by 2023."

However, in inflation adjusted dollars (which is more relevant, even though it doesn’t feel any better) I am actually spending less. So in conclusion, I am not spending more in relative 2023 dollars than anyone else has every spent before for a round trip between LAX and Boston."

    "text": "Full Title: EVERYTHING IS AWFUL. OR IS IT? - A LIMITED SCOPE OF THE COST OF AIR TRAVEL THROUGH THE YEARS (ONE THING THAT MAY NOT* BE OBJECTIVELY AWFUL)\nShort Title: LIMITED SCOPE ANALYSIS OF Q2 AIRFARE IN THE U.S. OVER THE LAST 4 DECADES\nAuthor: Adaeze Obinelo\nIntroduction:\nToday’s political, economic, and social climate seems to be, on a good day, a succession of inconveniences, and on the worst of days, a never-ending cascade of unprecedented challenges and horrors. Especially thanks to recent economic inflation, everyday necessities are taking a greater and greater toll on the average consumer’s wallet. Via the consumer price index (CPI) (NBC news, 2023), the overall costs of food, gas and shelter increased significantly over the summer. This increase was certainly felt acutely here in Los Angeles, where gas rose as high as $6 in some areas, and food prices continued to climb. Purchasing my airfare home this year, I felt the sting on my wallet particularly severely, and I found myself wondering “were airplane tickets always this high?”. I am not inexperienced in air travel, having flown frequently prior to college for athletics, during undergrad, and now as an adult to visit family. For some reason, when I think back to purchasing my tickets in the past, I cannot recall feeling the same unenthusiastic and reluctant resignation that I felt this year. For this reason, I thought it would be an interesting investigation to answer the following question; “How has airfare changes in the past few decades”. The present report aims to do exactly this, using the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) data on airfare.\nMethods:\nThe following analysis was conducted using the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistic’s (BTS) record of Average Domestic Itinerary Fares. This dataset is compiled each financial quarter (Q1-Q4), and the most recent financial quarter data available is from Q2 of 2023. For each quarter, the dataset compiles average flight fares by airport by year, year and these fares by a variable called “2022 Passenger Rank”, which is an ordinal variable calculated by comparing the value equivalent to 10% of all passengers served in 2022 (a variable also included in each dataset).\nDue to the data limitations for the current financial year, data from the second financial quarter of 4 years, 1993, 2003, 2013, and 2023 was utilized for analysis. A 10-year spread was thought to be ideal for assessing the general trends in airfare data. The datasets from this chosen time frames were downloaded directly from the Transportation Bureau’s website, using the above link, into .csv filed. Most of the data processing and cleaning was done using the dplyr, tidyverse and baseR packages. As part of data processing, variables names were altered to aid in the coding process. Variable types were changed to the appropriate type (continuous or character). Included in each dataset was ‘2022 Passengers’, a variable which compares the number of domestic passengers each airport sees in 2022. A missing value or a value of 0 indicate these airports don’t provide commercial domestic flights, so entries with these values were removed since they would not be airports the consumer is choosing from.\nTo additional analysis, coordinate data was taken from The Humanitarian Data Exchange which compiled a dataset of longitude and latitude values for 508 major US airports. This coordinate dataset was merged with the BTS datasets. Cross-validation was done by comparing the inflation adjusted fare variable for each year (Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2) provided originally with my dataset with an actual dollar to dollar conversion between that year and 2023(Table 1: Results of cross-validation). A new variable, “check.adj.xx” was created for each year of analysis by multiplying the (Average_xxxx) for each year by the inflation adjustment to the 2023 dollar value (1993: 2.13, 2003: 1.67, 2013: 1.32, 2023: 1). States were categorized into “East” and “West” by U.S. census geographic zones, with Northeast, south and Midwest considered “East” and all remaining states considered “West”.\nGiven that the research question centers around LAX and BOS airports, the overall dataset was queried for trends in relation to these two airports. Due to the great geographic distance between these airports, the overall dataset was stratified by location to better understand region-specific baseline trends. Scatterplots were used to visualize trends between continuous variables. Bar plots were used to visualize continuous variables by geographic location.\nResults\nThe Passenger Rank of LAX and BOS remained constant across all four time frames sampled; BOS ranking 6th, and LAX ranking 1st (Table 3), indicating that both airports see an extremely high number of US domestic flights per time frame sampled. However, neither LAX nor BOS were in states found to have the most expensive airport to fly out of in any of the Q2 data sampled: The state with the highest average adjusted airfare in 1993 was Georgia (477.24, Table 1), the state with the highest average adjusted airfare in 2003 was New Mexico (531.44, Table 1), and the state with the highest adjusted average airfare in 2013 and 2023 was Alaska (596.00 and 641.09, Table 1). In comparison, the average airfare for California for 1993, 2003, 2013, and 2023 was 354.04, 342.62, 401.70 and 403.09, and the average airfare in Massachusetts for the same timepoints was 305.94, 426.40, 363.57, 392.25. The most expensive airport to fly out of in 2023 was Cold Bay Airport in Alaska, and the least expensive to fly out of was Santa Maria in California (Figure 4).\nComparing Passenger Rank to Inflation Adjusted Fare, it appears that as passenger rank increases in the Western states, Inflation Adjusted Average fare tended to increase for all time points (Figure 1). This trend was largely mirrored in the Eastern U.S. States, for all years except 1993, where there did not appear to be a strong association between passenger rank and fare (Figure 2). Importantly, it appears that adjusted airfare is lower in 2023 than it has been for the other time points in both the east and the west. Comparing the dollar amount of the average ticket at Logan and LAX between 1993 and 2023, one would be paying around $369 less for a ticket out of BOS, and around $279 less for a ticket out of LAX.\nConclusion\n            Evidently, by inflation adjusted values, I am paying less for a trip between LAX and BOS than I have in the past. This begs the question of why it feels as if I am not. This can probably be answered best by looking at the unadjusted fare comparisons in Figure 3. Looking specifically at unadjusted fares out of Logan and LAX by year which show that overall, the unadjusted fare for airline tickets out of LAX and BOS are higher in 2023 than compared to years prior. While inflation adjusted values provide a good gauge of the “true” cost of a purchase in relation to the strength of the dollar, unadjusted amounts are the “ouch” one feels when actually paying for something in the moment. Since the unadjusted values are higher than they have been in the past, this is likely why it anecdotally feels like airfare prices are going up.\nThe above study does have significant limitations, namely that limitations in man-power limit our analysis to 4 timepoints separated by a decade. Due to this, this analysis definitely misses more acute variation in the dataset, and additionally does not account for the remaining financial quarters of the year.The above study does have significant limitations, namely that limitations in man-power limit our analysis to four time points separated by a decade. Due to this, this analysis definitely misses more acute variation in the dataset, and additionally does not account for the remaining financial quarters of the year. However, limited though it may be, it does provide a bit of assurance to those of us purchasing airfare.\nCitations:\nJay, M. (2023, September 13).
