    "text": "Methods\nThe following analysis was conducted using the United States Bureau of Transportation Statistic’s (BTS) record of Average Domestic Itinerary Fares. This dataset is compiled each financial quarter (Q1-Q4), and the most recent financial quarter data available is from Q2 of 2023. For each quarter, the dataset compiles average flight fares by airport. Included for each airport was a variable called ‘2022 Passengers’, which compares the number of domestic passengers each airport saw for that time period to the number of passengers the same airport sees on average in the year 2022. This variable was used to calculate another variable “2022 Passenger Rank”, assigns an ordinal rank to each airport by comparing the value equivalent to 10% of all passengers served in 2022.\nMissing Values: The dataset did not have missing values for average fares, however, it did have values of 0 or 1 for the variable “2022 Passenger Rank”. A missing value or a value of 0 for “2022 Passenger Rank” indicates that these airports don’t provide commercial domestic flights, so entries with these values were removed (since they would not be airports the consumer is choosing from)\nCoordinate data: For the purpose of additional analysis, coordinate data was taken from The Humanitarian Data Exchange which compiled a dataset of longitude and latitude values for 508 major US airports. This coordinate dataset was merged with the BTS datasets.\nValidation: Cross-validation was done by comparing the inflation adjusted fare variable for each year (Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2) provided originally with my dataset with an dollar to dollar conversion between that year and 2023.\nConversions:\n1993: 1-&gt;2.13\n2003: 1-&gt;1.67\n2013: 1-&gt;1.32\n\n\n  Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2_1993 check.adj.93 Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2_2003 check.adj.03\n1                   219.846     221.9758                   402.720     406.0605\n2                   267.383     269.9732                   393.425     396.6885\n3                   281.144     283.8672                   385.678     388.8779\n4                   283.787     286.5361                   400.977     404.3037\n5                   286.958     289.7375                   379.557     382.7055\n  Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2_2013 check.adj.13 Adjusted_Avg_Fare_Q2_2023 check.adj.23\n1                   208.124     210.4159                   176.255      176.255\n2                   544.805     550.8070                   461.966      461.966\n3                   457.750     462.7933                   392.579      392.579\n4                   516.517     522.2078                   443.932      443.932\n5                   439.538     444.3806                   355.561      355.561\n\n\nThe results indicate a very close coincidence between the BTS inflation adjusted fare and our calculated conversion variable, indicating that the dataset is valid with regards to fare cost.\nAnalysis: Given that the research question centers around LAX and BOS airports, the overall dataset was queried for trends in relation to these two airports. Due to the great geographic distance between these airports, the overall dataset was stratified by location to better understand region-specific baseline trends. Scatterplots were used to visualize trends between continuous variables. Bar plots were used to visualize continuous variables by categorical variables."

Again, 2023 fares range lower than in previous decades when comparing inflation adjusted averages. From these figures, its starting to look like I might actually be paying less to fly out of LAX and BOS, two high traffic airports, than I would be in previous years.\n\n\nGeographic Un-adjusted Fare Comparison\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking specifically at Logan and LAX by year, it appears that the average ticket out of Logan stagnated between 1993 and 2003, then uptrended between 2013 and 2023. The average ticket out of LAX uptrended slightly between 1993 and 2003, then increased more significantly between 2013 and 2023. On average, the price of a ticket out of Logan was higher than a ticket out of LAX in 1993 and 2003, but below a ticket our of LAX in 2013 and 2023.\nHow much compared to 1993?\n\n\n  Airport comp_fare\n1     BOS   369.449\n2     LAX   278.577\n\n\n[1] 648.026\n\n\nOn average, I would be paying $648 more for a round trip in 1993 when comparing inflation adjusted rates. So it looks like, at least comparing the years that I did, I actually have it better off with what I pay now compared to what I would be paying in 1993."

    "text": "Conclusion\nEvidently, by inflation adjusted values, I am paying less for a trip between LAX and BOS than I have in the past. This begs the question of why it feels as if I am not. This can probably be answered best by looking at the unadjusted fare comparisons in Figure 3. Looking specifically at unadjusted fares out of Logan and LAX by year show that overall, the unadjusted fare for airline tickets out of LAX and BOS are higher in 2023 than compared to years prior. While inflation adjusted values provide a good gauge of the “true” cost of a purchase in relation to the strength of the dollar, unadjusted amounts are the “ouch” one feels when actually paying for something in the moment. Since the unadjusted values are higher than they have been in the past, this is likely why it anecdotally feels like airfare prices are going up.\nThe above study does have significant limitations, namely that limitations in man-power limit our analysis to 4 timepoints separated by a decade. Due to this, this analysis definitely misses more acute variation in the dataset, and additionally does not account for the remaining financial quarters of the year.The above study does have significant limitations, namely that limitations in man-power limit our analysis to four time points separated by a decade. Due to this, this analysis definitely misses more acute variation in the dataset, and additionally does not account for the remaining financial quarters of the year. However, limited though it may be, it does provide a bit of assurance to those of us purchasing airfare."
